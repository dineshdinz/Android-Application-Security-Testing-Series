# Android-Application-Security-Testing-Series
Android Application Security testing Series. This series discus about  Android Application’s  basics and how to test the Application against OWASP top 10(2017).

Welcome to Android Application Security testing Series. Brisk infosec solution presents a series of blog about, how to do android application security testing.  For information security researchers or professionals, the mobile space also represents a fairly new and sparsely charted continent to explore, with diverse geography in the form of different processor architectures, hardware peripherals, software stacks, and operating systems. All of these create an ecosystem for a diverse set of vulnerabilities to exploit and study.

who can follow this ? 

Penetration Testers, Security Researchers, Security Analyst, Android developer .

How to make myself ready before reading this blog ?

Android application security testing series covers from basic to advance, so no need to worry about preparing yourself. Its good to aware about OWASP TOP 10 vulnerabilities for web application.
